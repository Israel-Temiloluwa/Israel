# About me
I'm an Electrical Electronics Engineering student at the University of Lagos. I'm a tech enthusiast and I enjoy learning about ways to create new technologies. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS and getting better with JavaScript. At the moment, Iâ€™m learning React JS.

Outside the world of tech, I love learning more about my course of study in school and getting better at what I already know.
